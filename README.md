Array Structure Comparison: C++ vs JavaScript

Fixed Stack Dynamic

Description: Stack with a fixed size (LIFO). No resizing. Overflow/underflow messages on push/pop errors.

C++: int arr[5];

JS: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

Stack Dynamic

Description: Dynamically growing stack. No fixed size.

C++: std::vector

JS: [] with .push()

Fixed Heap Dynamic

Description: Fixed-size array on the heap. No resizing. Direct index access.

C++: new int[5];

JS: new Array(5).fill(0);

Heap Dynamic

Description: Automatically resizing array. Ideal for growing data.

C++: std::vector

JS: [] with .push()

When to Use What

Fixed Stack Dynamic: Known max size, simple stack.

Stack Dynamic: Unknown or growing stack size.

Fixed Heap Dynamic: Known size, heap allocation.

Heap Dynamic: Flexible, resizable array.

Memory: C++ = manual (stack/heap), JS = automatic (heap with GC).
